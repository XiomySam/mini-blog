<p> Hello Hello! Welcome to the little corner of the internet called <em>Cece's Mini Gaming Blog.</em> This mini-blog is where I, Cece, will write reveiews
  on games that I come across, talk about video game media, and sometimes share music playlists as well. This blog first started on 5 December 2022.
</p>

<h2>Mission / Purpose</h2>
The original intent of this little blog is for the assignment in Professor Kapper's "Fundamentals of Interactive Design" class called "Create your own
site using CSS.".

<h2>What is Cece working on?</h2>
<p>A review of a mobile game targeted for girls known as <em>Time Princess.</em></p>

<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>Ah yes. The rules section. Here are the rules that I abide by. Please spare a moment to read them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am not qualified to give legitimate and true opinions unlike other websites.</li>
  <li>Please do not rush me for reviews / opinion pieces. A degree-seeking life is a busy one.</li>
  <li>I am not too keen on horror video games or media outside of Halloween. Do not ask for reviews on them outside of that window.</li>
  <li>Please be advised that I do have biases of own and that they may cloude judgement.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy your stay!</p>
