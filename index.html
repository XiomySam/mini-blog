<p> Hello Hello! Welcome to the little corner of the internet called <em><strong>Cece's Mini Gaming Blog.</strong></em> This mini-blog is where I, Cece, will write reveiews
  on games that I come across, talk about video game media, and sometimes share music playlists as well. This blog started on 5 December 2022 and met it's end at 9 December
  due to the news that the software <em>atom.io</em> was sunsetting/closing down.
</p>

<h2>Mission / Purpose</h2>
<p>The original intent of this little blog is for the assignment in Professor Kapper's "Fundamentals of Interactive Design" class called "Create your own
site using CSS.". Using this website, I was going to show off what I had learned in both HTML and CSS. However, when the deadline came for the website to be
uploaded, this website did not meet the assignment requirements.
</p>

<h2>What is Cece working on?</h2>
<p>A review of a mobile game targeted for girls known as <em>Time Princess.</em></p>

<h2>Rules and Notices</h2>
<p>Ah yes. The rules section. Here are the rules that I abide by. Please spare a moment to read them.</p>

<ol>
  <li>I am not qualified to give legitimate and true opinions unlike other websites.</li>
  <li>Please do not rush me for reviews / opinion pieces. A degree-seeking life is a busy one!</li>
  <li>I am not too keen on horror video games or media outside of Halloween. Do not ask for reviews on them outside of that window.</li>
  <li>Please be advised that I do have biases of own and that they may cloud judgement.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Enjoy your stay!</strong></p>
