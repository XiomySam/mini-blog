</p><em>Hello Hello everyone!</em></p>

<p>Today I’ve decided to talk about one of Ikemen Prince’s romance options: Luke Randolph, also known as “The Indolent Charmer” or the 8th Prince. His crest/coat of arms is a bear, has a love of honey (sounds like Winnie the Pooh!), and is also the tallest of the men at a towering 6’0. From what I’ve seen, he is a goofy boy who just got thrown into the palace without warning. He’s also still trying to figure out who he is in my eyes. As the youngest prince (a whopping 18 years old) I can’t help but baby him. He is younger than me, I can’t exactly help that…nor the feelings I have about him being a romance option.</p>

<p><strong>PREFACE:</strong> I have not played Luke Randolph’s route, as his route is deemed very mature by the community. To others, his route is all over the place. I also am American, so some of the beliefs I have might not hold up to everyone else.</p>

<p>According to
  <a href="https://hakuoyuki.tumblr.com/post/632134265756434432/what-are-the-ages-of-the-ikepri-characters/" target="_blank">this one tumblr post</a>, the MC (whose name is Emma if you don’t choose one yourself) is older than 18 but younger than 24. Considering how Emma talks about how her friends are all married and debating having children in the prologue, it’s safe to assume that she might be closer to 22-24. Since the game doesn’t have a set period unlike Ikemen Vampire or Ikemen Sengoku, I can’t search as to what was the average age that women were married and debating children/possibly having children during Ikemen Prince’s time period. Even if I were to even attempt to make that kind of deduction, the introduction of the fictional country “Obsidian” throws everything out of the water. According to the story, the country of Obsidian already has handguns created for military use and can nurture someone back to health despite being crushed by debris/building collapse while the other countries can’t even fathom the idea of iron being melted in such a way. So, I can’t assume a time period. But for the sake of this opinion piece, I will argue that MC is around 23 years old. Meanwhile, Luke is a concrete 18. That leaves us with a rough five-year age difference.</p>

<p>Now five years isn’t too crazy. Compared to Sariel, the oldest, five years is a lot more palatable to me than eleven years. However, the age difference gives me an uncomfortable feeling. As someone whose own parents are only a year apart and also has a six-year difference from her brother, I’m a little opposed to the relationship between Emma and Luke. I perceive their relationship more as a friendship than anything, despite what the event stories would make you believe. If one of my brother’s friends ran up to me and wanted to be friends, that is fine. If we became besties, that’s alright. Natural progression sees me being the friend’s pseudo-older-sister and the friend being my pseudo-younger-brother from where I see it. Shoot, I would even help him with his homework like how I would my brother. The friend might ask for advice on girls so he can get a girl and I would give a hearty laugh before I assist him. I can try to imagine feelings coming out of that theoretical relationship, but it would more than likely be the friend having unrequited feelings for me for a moment before eventually surrendering those feelings. That’s how I see it, and that’s because of my upbringing.</p>


<h2>&ldquo;Barely Legal&rdquo;</h2>

<p>However, this is not the case for Luke and Emma. As the event stories have it, little Miss Emma here and Luke do take their relationship further. Yes, ~further~, as the dialogue implies when he says something similar to “Oh yeah. Does that make you feel good?” in the previews for a particular story event about Emma getting physically intimate with the man of your choosing. This is where the “Barely Legal” argument now comes into play. I’m not sure if Luke just turned eighteen when the main events of the plot happened or if he’s on the brink of being nineteen but the whole “Barely Legal” card comes into play. For those not aware of this card, it’s pretty self-explanatory. A character will either be released as 18 (which is the legal adult age in most, if not all countries) or have their age get adjusted in an update to be 18, therefore excusing most actions the fanbase or other characters might have toward the character, while sometimes avoiding issues. For example, Chang Pu in Lilith Games’ <em>Dislyte.</em></p>

<p>When Chang Pu was released, she was a minor. I believe she was fifteen. The community is notorious for giving in to their carnal desires and being vocal about them, and Chang Pu was not spared from their NSFW comments. This made the large majority of players in the community upset since grown individuals (mostly straight men) were dropping all kinds of sexual comments about a fictional teenage girl. To stop some of this damage, Lilith Games changed Chang Pu’s age to 18. Now, everything was allowed. All kinds of jokes could be said, along with comments and God only knows what else. Ever since then, the minimum age of Dislyte characters is 18 to avoid that from happening again. For example, The Fatum Sisters are all 18. Mona is 18. Hence, the “Barely Legal” card. I feel like Luke Randolph fits into this category. And to have him be tossed into a rather intimate and physical event story at the tender age of eighteen seems a little off to me.</p>

<p>Now, I am fully aware that anyone can no longer be a virgin before they turn eighteen. I distinctly remember my first year of high school in which my friend who was maybe fourteen, a handful of months away from fifteen at the time bragged about how she nearly lost her virginity. I am also aware that since Luke is a prince and therefore a royal in this fictional universe that under some technicality, he could have lost his virginity at an earlier age and it could all get swept under the rug. Considering how the real-world <a href="https://www.thelist.com/116110/royals-babies-young/" target="_blank">Queen Sirkit of Thailand</a> had a child when she was just seventeen, it is a possibility. But I still feel like Luke being eighteen years old and romancing a woman who’s five years older than him is weird, especially if you take in some of Emma’s context.</p>


<h2>Emma: The plight of a 23-year-old woman.</h2>

<p>As a reminder, all of Emma’s friends are married and considering children. Emma herself? Well, she’s a young lady wasting her “birthing years” as some would call it, running a bookstore in which her only romance comes from someone else’s written words attached to a lovely spine. Her pride and joy are those numerous pages protected by leather and the like, with her assistant Rio occasionally helping her out with tasks around the town or within the bookstore. Considering how content she is and doesn’t bother to act on her desires to change her life, her life’s trajectory sees her dying like how Isaac Newton did: a 92-year-old virgin. And I guarantee you that in a real-world setting, some of her fellow townspeople would feel the same way about her. But here’s where I no longer am part of that crowd. Emma is 23. She’s young. She has a job. And she’s unmarried and without kids. This opens up the whole “When are we having grandkids?” Line of questioning and/or thought process. You know what I mean.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><em><strong>“When are you having kids? When are you going to get a boyfriend? You can’t get a husband dressed like that! No boy is going to want someone who eats that kind of food, so stop. Don’t wear flats, wear heels. Lower the hems of your dresses. A lady doesn’t say ___, they say __________. You can only be so young for so long, so you must take advantage of everything now, especially the romance scene! Your (insert body part here) will work in your favor…”</em></strong></p>

<p><em>That</em>. Now I don’t detect a parental presence in Emma’s life at this point, nor a flurry of gossiping women. But she would have to deal with that mentally at one point, considering how many weddings her friends invited her to. At this point in her life, she’s supposed to be married and with children. Running the house. Being responsible for not just her life but a tiny human’s life as well. Make sure everyone’s fed. But she’s not, and some would argue that society’s pressure to get married and have kids definitely affects people. Combine all of that with the fact that she’s working a bookstore that leaves her in her solitude for most hours of the day and you get someone who is leagues under her friends but surprisingly leagues above Luke Randolph, the youngest of the princes. She’s at a different point in her life compared to him. Cece from five years ago and Cece now are two different people. Emma from five years ago and Emma now are two different people, the same applies to Luke. Emma and Luke are not on the same level in this category. She’s a few years away from having her “prime years” (referring to her getting married and safely having kids) end. Her life in the bookstore is all she is going to know. This is it. It’s all settled.</p>

<p>Luke, on the other hand, is still trying to figure out who he is. All he knows is that he’s not keen on becoming the next king of Rhodolite. From his route preview, it seems that he might become an official prince (as he is a bastard child) with a sense of conviction to him. To me, he is on the path of discovery. He’s just been chucked out of the bird's nest, just now learning what wings are, not even what they do yet. I remember when I was eighteen trying to navigate the world. I got catcalled, attended the graduation, got hit with that “What do I do now?” feeling, a huge bout of sadness, signed up for college, joined classes, and lost a family friend&hellip;it’s a lot. I didn’t realize how much bigger the real world was until I finished high school. This planet has so much going on, it terrifies me at times. I find myself asking for an adult, even! And I’m sure that Luke Randolph feels at least some of that, as he went from his life in bum haven nowhere to the royal palace of Rhodolite. There’s so much he has to tackle before he can finally settle down again. Be himself. Breathe. Figure out who he is right now and navigate the world. He doesn’t know what to expect from life. He doesn’t know what he’s going to do for a job. He doesn’t have any kind of stability right now, or maybe he does but can’t feel it just yet. He hasn’t even entertained the idea of having a family or raising a child. Meanwhile, Emma is established and content with her life. She’s okay with where it’s taking her. She does not feel obligated to change anything in her mellow life in the slightest. She’s entertained the idea of little tikes running around calling her “Mama”. Meanwhile Luke is swimming in a deep ocean as a tempest hits him with full force. They are at such different places in their lives that pursuing an intimate and deep relationship seems out of place.</p>

<p>If you were to compare Luke with his other brothers, at least they are more established and perhaps ready for a genuine relationship. They know who they are and they have no qualms hammering that into your brain from what I’ve seen. They have their issues that they work on or refuse to work on. They know what the future has in store for them for the most part. They are content with their lives like Emma is for the most part. They can handle a change in monarchy/position if they get chosen to be king. Emma can almost snap into a near-perfect place with Luke’s older brothers. Emma doesn’t have to help any of them get through a serious developmental stage in their lives. Emma doesn’t have to play mentor to some degree with any of the other princes. She doesn’t have to coddle the others like how she would Luke. Emma and Luke are so different in terms of where they are in life: Emma is an adult woman content and established in society while Luke is just a boy reconnecting with society, among other things. I just can’t see the romance happening at this point. I can see Emma holding Luke’s hand in both the figurative and literal sense, but nothing more.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I feel uncomfortable with Luke and Emma pursuing a romantic and possibly physically intimate relationship. They are at almost vastly different points in their lives. Luke is still trying to figure out who he is while Emma has her life set and ready to go. He needs more guidance than anything else right now, not a relationship. Had this been five more years into the future with Luke being 23 and Emma being 28, then I would say that the relationship might be better as Luke would have been more adjusted to his new lifestyle and ready for romance. Things would be so unfair. However, this is not the case. Luke is still just a boy who has no idea what’s going on right now. There’s a high chance that he doesn’t even have proper boundaries set, unlike Emma does.<p>

<br>

<h2>After Thoughts</h2>

<p>Before I go, I just want to mention a few things before I wrap it all up in a bow. It is okay if you disagree with me. It is more than okay if you believe that the age gap does not make that much of a difference and that I’m being overly dramatic or something similar. I personally just find it weird and uncomfortable to me. Should I ever encounter a similar situation like this in real life, I am not going to stop the 23-year-old and 18-year-old from loving each other. It is what it is, and I am going to respect those decisions. I just think that it is best if Emma and Luke pursue a platonic relationship instead of a romantic one considering the maturity and life differences between the two. It also feels unfair that Emma is dating someone who she will have to guide through a major developmental stage in life instead of someone who is on par with her. But it is what it is. At the end of the day, this is a romance game with each character embodying at least one trope. And as I pointed out earlier, everything is legal.</p>

<em>Lastly, please don’t send hate to CYBIRD or any fans of the character, Luke Randolph!</em>
