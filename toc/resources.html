  <h2>Books</h2>
  <p>#1: Learning Web Design</p>
  <p>By Jennifer Nierderst Robbins</p>
  <p><strong>ISBN: </strong>978-1-491-96020-2</p>
  <p>Publisher: O'Reilly Media; 5th edition (June 19, 2018)</p>
  <p>Edition: 5th</p>
  <p>Link: <a href="https://learningwebdesign.com/" target="_blank">Learning Web Design</a></p>

  <p>I jokingly call this textbook “the Bible” whenever I have it on me or talk about it. This book is so vital that this page wouldn’t have been made without it! This book makes web design so much easier for a beginner like me/ Trust me when I say that this one also treats you like a person versus others that make you hit the ground with a horrific “Splat!” noise.  I’m almost considering buying it for myself, considering how my major might have me expanding in the field of web design. This book has been nothing but helpful almost every time I used it! I highly recommend it and it’s learning materials!</p>

  <p>#2 - Graphic Design Solutions</p>
  <p>By Robin Landa</p>
  <p><strong>ISBN: </strong>978-1-337-55405-3</p>
  <p>Publisher: Cengage Learning</p>
  <p>Edition: 6th</p>
  <p>Link: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-Solutions-Robin-Landa/dp/1337554057" target="_blank">Graphic Design Solutions (Amazon)</a><p>


  <p>Now this is if you’re genuinely pursuing more creative and expressive routes. Web design and overall artistic design go hand-in-hand sometimes! Imagine spending hours creating a functional website, only for everything to show up on a white background with varying sizes of a black Times New Roman font. Alternatively, imagine you have to create a banner for your profile but don’t know where to start. This book will help with that! The examples are lovely, the book didn’t bore me to death with glossary terms and the examples shine as bright as the sun sometimes. Only downside is that the formatting can be a little unconventional at times, but I think that adds to the charm!</p>

  <p>#3: Introduction to Java Programming and Data Structures, Comprehensive Version</p>
  <p>By Y. Daniel Liang</p>
  <p><strong>ISBN: </strong>978-0-136-52023-8</p>
  <p>Publisher: Pearson</p>
  <p>Edition: 12th</p>
  <p>Link: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Structures-Comprehensive-Version/dp/0134670949" target="_blank"></a></p>

  <p>I have this book saved in my Amazon cart! Now granted, this is the heaviest book at almost 4 lbs but!! It is nothing but helpful. To some, they consider it “the Bible” of Javascript coding. I also agree with those people! I only explored about eight chapters of this book during my introductory course but I was using my money’s worth with those eight chapters. I would honestly like to rent this book again and see what else I can do with its definitions and examples! The only downside (outside of price) is that the font can be small and like I mentioned before, the weight of this book is out there.</p>

  <h2>Websites</h2>

  <p>#1: w3c Schools</p>
  <p>Link: <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools</a></p>
  <p>This little nifty website has aided me in some small ways while making this website, so I figured I would share.!They cover so many realms when ti comes to coding that it’s no surprise when they almost always show up for my search results! Apparently they can help you get certified as well, which doesn’t hurt!</p>

  <br>

  <p>#2: Color Picker</p>
  <p>Link: <a href="https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/" target="_blank">HTML Color Picker</a></p>
  <p>Absolutely wonderful for finding a color palette. Incredibly ease to use, lets you to lock colors to make your own palette, allows you to download your palettes and even describes what the different color options are. Very nice for beginners!</p>

  <br>

  <p>#3: Color Palettes</p>
  <p>Link: <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target="_blank">Adobe Color</a></p>
  <p>Provides mostly the same content as the previous website, just provided by Adobe. It’s more about giving colors than anything, along with deep dives behind the color values chosen.</p>

  <br>

  <p>#4: Google Fonts</p>
  <p>Link: <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a></p>
  <p>So! You like fonts/typefaces but don’t know where to go. One stop shop right here with Google Fonts! (Hehe! My title is a Google font.) It’s like the Adobe Fonts website except free! Might not get the exact same fonts, but it’s still incredibly reliable. Definitely would recommend to those who want to add more flavor to their websites.</p>

  <h2>Videos</h2>

  <p>#1: Intro to Java Programming - Course for Absolute Beginners</p>
  <p>Link: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=GoXwIVyNvX0" target="_blank">Youtube</a></p>
  <p>This one is more like a personal bookmark to me. Having to switch between JavaScript and HTML was interesting to say the least. Now I will be honest, I only spent an hour working with this video but! At no point did I feel smaller, dumber or awful when following this man’s tutorial. It has shining reviews in the comments about how insightful he is compared to actual JavaScript classes. I would recommend this video for someone just starting out!</p>
