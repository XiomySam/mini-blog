<h2>Biography</h2>
<p> Hello Hello! My name is Xiomy Sam <em><strong>(Sea-O-Me)</strong></em>, but I occasionally go by Cece or Zeze depending on the crowd. I learned very early on in my life that my name is very difficult for Americans to pronounce, so I opted for a nickname to stop the amount of real-time assassinations of my lovely name. Unsurprisingly, I love to play video games. My preference tends to be games I can play on the phone, since console games tend to carry a heftier price tag and sometimes an extensive level of dedication that I as a college student can’t give right now. If I’m not playing my spare hour or two away on my phone, I usually end up watching walkthroughs of popular games. Trust me when I say that an hours-long walkthrough of a game will beat some TV shows without question!
</p>

<p>
  In my very tiny family of four, I am the oldest sibling! I am my parent’s favorite and only daughter, second only to the dog in terms of who gets called “Princess.” I have a younger brother that I sometimes will call my “Baby Brother” despite him being only six years younger than me. I love him dearly, and he is my second-player for every console game we play. No Straight Roads? Call me Mayday, he’s Zuke. LEGO anything? We’re collecting studs, finding Stan Lee, getting all the gold bricks and causing chaos. Even when Kinect Adventures was still functional, we were stopping 20,000 leaks under the sea, racing down rivers in a raft, and popping as many bubbles as possible. Oh! Can’t forget about Xoey, our doodle! This hairball of energy, durability and licks-for-days is my sentient anti-depressant. If I ever move out of the house and earn a stable enough paycheck, I am taking full custody of her and my parents will celebrate. And thanks to me and my Instagram dog/influencer dreams, she now has an aversion to selfies. Nothing a “snacksies” can’t fix.
</p>

<p>
  And to answer the obligatory “Where do you see yourself in five years?” The answer is always: With a degree and some internship experience, preferably. Please and thank you.
