<h2>Biography</h2>
<p> Hello! My name is Xiomy Sam <em><strong>(Sea-O-Me)</strong></em>, a Paul J. Hagerty High School graduate. During my years at Hagerty High School, I was a member of the Modeling and Simulation Club (known as ModSquad) for four years, and was a member of the physics-based SECME club for two years.
  I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Game Design, under the Digital Media specification. I am in my second year at Seminole State College of Florida, working towards my Associates in the Arts degree.</p>
<p>By Fall of 2023, I will transfer over to the University of Central Florida to continue my undergraduate degree. I am currently a member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, under the Pi Lambda chapter of Seminole State College of Florida. I am also a member of the Digital Media Club at Seminole State as well. I canâ€™t wait to start creating game art and getting involved in game design!</p>
